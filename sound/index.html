<p>I’ve been a professional musician since the late 80’s. Below is a brief sampling of music that I wrote either solo or in bands situations. I’ve enjoyed some notoriety, but also have learned that it takes roughly 6 months for your artistry to make it to the cut out bin… oof-da. Along the way I’ve made countless life-long friendships with some of the coolest people you would ever want to meet. Hopefully you’ll enjoy the music below.</p>

<p>This is culled from a selection of songs I created initially to build out a sketch book for use in rehearsal. The intention was to basically use one or two of the songs, to build a band around and have something to play right from the start. This song, “Green Limousine” was the first song I assembled in Garage Band. It was literally the first time I played after recovering from a hand injury. Listen to the rest of the

<p>I co-founded this band with Lorna Donley (former bassist, vocalist for DA!, the Veil) after leaving firetruck. We went from woodshed-ing songs to being signed in 6 months. It was an experience to say the least. This song “Divine Light” is one of my favorite songs from our label compilation debut. The song itself was based on a riff that the drummer and I were playing around with at the time. Lorna came up wtih the chorus and made it magical.</p>

<p>Everyone has their first band and this was mine. I co-founded this band with Fred Mangum. Basically, this was a hard rock band with punk overtones. Our lead singer David Hoffman was actually a poet. So in essence we were a very loud poetry band. Fred would go on to be associated with the “Wesley Willis Fiasco” as well as build custom guitars from found objects. “Driven” was a song I brought into the band that the band completed.</p>

<p>What do you do when your oldest friend calls and asks you join his band? You get your gear and go. Treeshakers was an existing band that I was asked to join by the founding members, all of whom I had known since childhood. Weirdly, all of us grew up in that same neighborhood and all of us were signed at various points, was there something in the water? Treeshakers are straight up power-pop. We played the IPO Chicago on numerous occasions, and opened for the Aussie band “Great Atlantic” on their mid-west tour. This song “Moving On” was written by Tony the principle leader of the band.</p>
